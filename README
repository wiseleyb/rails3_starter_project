== MySql

Just run rake db:migrate

== Devise

https://github.com/plataformatec/devise

Supports basic user login/logout stuff - see their site for details.  To muck with the views edit things in the views/devise directory.

== Redis

First, install Redis:  

	fname=redis-2.0.0-rc2
	wget http://redis.googlecode.com/files/$fname.tar.gz
	tar -zxf $fname.tar.gz
	mv $fname redis
	cd redis
	make
	sudo cp redis-server /usr/bin
	sudo cp redis.conf /etc/ 
	sudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/redis-server

Second - uncomment and configure the Redis code in config/initializes/constants.rb

Third - configure the .conf files in config/redis

Fourth - start up redis and point it at your dev conf:  cd /usr/bin && sudo ./redis-server ~/dev/YOURAPP/config/redis/development.conf

== Common Utils

See it's README

== Country Select

See it's README

== Blue Print 

Already included - read their site for info on how to use blue print

== Moonshine

Edit the obvious stuff in config/moonshine.yml

Then mostly follow this blog excellent blog post by Josh:  http://blog.railsmachine.com/articles/2010/02/17/smooth-devoperations-deploying-rails-3-with-moonshine/comments#comment-9585

== Cucumber

Basic 1 == 1 test setup... config files created, etc.

== RVM

Edit the .rvmrc file to create a gem set for your project

== CanCan

See their documentation:  https://github.com/ryanb/cancan

== Paperclip

Users are setup to use Paperclip and Amazon's S3 storage for their avatars.  The sizes are defined in the User model - you'll probably want to cut down on options.

Default images are in public/images/avatars

Register/Login and click the "Show" link in the top nav to see the images.

Edit your registration to change images.  You'll need to fill in your info in config/s3.yml first

See their documentation:  https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip

== Amazon S3

Edit your information in config/s3.yml  

It's a good idea to manually create your buckets on Amazon's site (it throws wonky errors if they're not available)

== Contributing

PLEASE fork and put in pull requests if you find a bug or want to add stuff
